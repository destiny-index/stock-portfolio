1. Overall process
  Decided to generate the Cash Balance from a list of transactions

  Created two forms of transactions:
    Depositing/Withdrawing money from the Cash Balance
    Buying/Selling Stock Orders

  Made the app server responsible for fetching the current price 
  for building transactions involving Buying/Selling stock orders

  Build the UI to Deposit/Withdraw Cash and Buy/Sell Stock Orders

  Use Semantic UI to make the UI prettier

2. Shortcuts, simplifying assumptions, known bugs, etc.
  Assumed that one user would be enough for personal use
  Skipped user login and authentication
  Skipped form validation. e.g. It is possible to enter negative numbers

3. What slowed you down, what was unexpected
  Project Setup
    Setting up webpack, babel, and eslint is as time consuming as always

  Flow Types
    Flow server would repeatedly stop responding

4. Any problems you ran into
  Starting the app server and webpack dev server from one 'npm start'
    The solution was to start the both from a shell script and have
    npm run that shell script
